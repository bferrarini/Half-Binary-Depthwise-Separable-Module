# Training data
We used Places365 from http://places2.csail.mit.edu/download.html

The dataset is **Small images (256 x 256) with easy directory structure**

Once you download the data, modify the file *dataset_presets.py* to target your directories. 

# Test data
We include a few imaged from Nordland to test out of the box the code provided in this repository. Please, see the *readme.md* file at the root for the CLI command to use.
